      <h1>About Our Teacher</h1>
      <p>

        <h3>Skills and Work Experience</h3>

        Born and raised in a multicultural environment, I possess multilingual proficiency in Sinhala, English, and Japanese. My fluency in these three languages enables me to work effectively in diverse international educational settings. My experience as a child counsellor and crisis intervention consultant at an NGO has helped me adapt my teaching methods to accommodate different learning styles and address individual learning difficulties.
      <br> <br>

        With 15 years of teaching experience, I have worked as a lecturer in the English Department at the American College of Higher Education. During my tenure, I managed exams and contributed to the professional development of adult students.
      <br><br>

        <h3>My Teaching Method</h3>

        I incorporate modern teaching technologies to cater to the diverse learning styles of my students. In an authentic classroom environment, I use language games, visual aids for vocabulary, and the audio-lingual method with videos and audios. This approach allows second-language learners to engage with the cultural context of native English speakers. Having studied phonology as part of my degree, I effectively help students improve their pronunciation skills.
      <br><br>

        <h3>My Teaching Philosophy</h3>

        I believe that teaching English as a second or foreign language should be done in a student-centered, real-life context. The classroom should not be an artificial setting, but rather a space where students can immerse themselves in practical, real-world language use. This approach facilitates language acquisition rather than rote learning.
      <br><br>

        In pursuit of my passion for teaching, I founded my own educational institute, the "Centre for Effective English Teaching with Counselling," to continue my journey as a lifelong educator. Contributing to the academic and personal growth of my students brings immense joy, especially when I see the spark of understanding in their eyes as they grasp new concepts.</p>
