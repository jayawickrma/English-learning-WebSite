            <h2>About Our Teacher</h2>
            <p>Our teacher is very enthusiastic and friendly. She encourages every student to talk more and more, which builds confidence in English conversation. She teaches us gently, even when mistakes are made, creating a comfortable environment to learn and grow. It's truly inspiring and makes students eager to participate in class discussions.</p>
            <p>Through her guidance, I have greatly improved my English language skills and now love English even more. I quickly progressed during my time at CEETC, and it was a lot of fun the whole time. Her teaching methods are interactive, supportive, and effective, making learning enjoyable for everyone!</p>
